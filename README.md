### CREATE AN INPUT FIELD - 

1. Click the + button in the top left corner

2. It will bring up a menu with a dropdown, select what kind of input you want

You can edit what the input field has, every input field will also have 2 extra elements, "ShowSelected" and "Output", if you want the input field to be an output for the behaviour, set "Output" to 1, "ShowSelected" is for things that only show up when a drop down option, so if you have a dropdown, and you want an element below it to only show up when you selected "Skibidi, you can set "ShowSelected" to "Skibidi".

If you wanna add custom options to a dropdown, write in the "Elements" an array with this format: ["Op1", "Op2", "Op3"] and so on.
